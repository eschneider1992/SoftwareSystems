    *Bug Fixes and Changes since build 1600*

    *  The Windows 64-bit version of ActivePerl now supports building
       modules using the MinGW64 GCC compiler. You can download this
       compiler via PPM if you don't want to use the Windows 2003 Platform
       SDK compiler:

           ppm install MinGW64

       ActivePerl 5.16.1.1601 will download and install this package
       automatically if you try to build a Perl module and don't have a
       compiler available on your "PATH".

    *  On OS X ActivePerl will now automatically detect various versions
       of XCode and use the compiler and tools included in that app if you
       don't have the *Commandline Tools for OS X* installed.

    *  Significant changes that have occurred in the Perl 5.16.1 release
       are documented in perl5161delta.

    *  Most bundled modules have been updated to their latest released
       version from CPAN. Use the "ppm query" command to check the exact
       version included in this release.

  Build 1600 Jun 1, 2012
    *What's new in the 1600 Series*

    *  This build corresponds to the Perl 5.16.0 source code release.

    *  The 1600 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
       builds in the 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series. Any extensions
       built using binaries from the ActivePerl 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or
       1400 series will need to be recompiled. Note especially that this
       applies to PPM packages that may have been built for 600, 800,
       1000, 1200 or 1400 series builds.

    *  Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.16.0 release are
       documented in perl5160delta.

    *  Most bundled distributions have been updated to their latest
       released version from CPAN. Use the "ppm list" command to check the
       exact version included in this release.

<p><i>Bug Fixes and Changes since build 1600</i></p>

<ul>

<li><p>The Windows 64-bit version of ActivePerl now supports building modules using the MinGW64 GCC compiler. You can download this compiler via PPM if you don&#39;t want to use the Windows 2003 Platform SDK compiler:</p>

<pre><code>    ppm install MinGW64</code></pre>

<p>ActivePerl 5.16.1.1601 will download and install this package automatically if you try to build a Perl module and don&#39;t have a compiler available on your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On OS X ActivePerl will now automatically detect various versions of XCode and use the compiler and tools included in that app if you don&#39;t have the <i>Commandline Tools for OS X</i> installed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Significant changes that have occurred in the Perl 5.16.1 release are documented in <a href="./lib/pod/perl5161delta.html">perl5161delta</a>.</p>

<p><i>What&#39;s new in the 1600 Series</i></p>

<ul>

<li><p>This build corresponds to the Perl 5.16.0 source code release.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The 1600 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with builds in the 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series. Any extensions built using binaries from the ActivePerl 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series will need to be recompiled. Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been built for 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series builds.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.16.0 release are documented in <a href="./lib/pod/perl5160delta.html">perl5160delta</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Most bundled distributions have been updated to their latest released version from CPAN. Use the <code>ppm list</code> command to check the exact version included in this release.</p>

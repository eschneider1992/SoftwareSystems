	I'll say Hello diary. Today was the most interesting day. It was all I could do to stop from laughing and crying at the same time.
	You see, it all started with the dog. Ran right through the kitchen, and behind it came this swarm of monkeys. Swinging on the lights, leaping off the counters, it was the wildest damn thing I ever did see. The dog screamed and jumped through a window, and those monkeys just ran right on after it. I could hear them clamoring right up the drive. Am I going crazy?

	Dear diary, yes. Checked in an asylum today. Damn.
